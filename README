Description: It's an Xcas program that we insert a polynomial (such as 2k^3 + 3k^2 + k) and the output is a type of 
	     sums that give us the corresponding result. We use 3 intermediate functions in specific difference_delta, 
	     factorial_power and stirling. Each function gives us useful data in order to achieve our goal and they 
	     are somehow corresponding to the Mathematica's functions for the same use.
